    "Use the Seaborn objects interface with the `response_it_tt` DataFrame defined below to create a composite plot with bars, error bars, and individual data points, with study time on the x-axis, respose on the y-axis, and trial type represented by color. Shift the error bars by 0.05 (to the right), and the points by -0.05 (to the left). Set the jitter to 0.05. Set the `alpha` property of the `Bar` mark to 0.4 to make the other elements easier to see. Set the `linewidth` property of the `Range` mark to 4. Set the label for the x-axis to \"Item type\", the label for the y-axis to \"P(old)\", and the label for the color legend to \"Trial type\".\n",
